##  My Philosophy

> "Write code that your future self will thank you for."

I believe in:
- **Clean code over clever code**
- **Simple architecture over overengineering**
- **Documentation that actually helps**
- **Tests that save future pain**

##  Recent Adventures

###  Hot Takes
- **On Monoliths vs Microservices:** Architecture should match scale, not trends  
- **On Tabs vs Spaces:** Consistency > preference  
- **On Frameworks:** Tools change, fundamentals stay  

###  Currently Reading
- "The Pragmatic Programmer"  
- Rust documentation  
- My old code (to understand past mistakes)

##  Creative Corner

```javascript
// My approach to solving problems
function solveProblem(problem) {
    if (!problem) return "Define the problem first";

    const steps = [
        "Understand the requirements",
        "Design the solution",
        "Implement step by step",
        "Test",
        "Refactor",
        "Document"
    ];

    return steps;
}
```
